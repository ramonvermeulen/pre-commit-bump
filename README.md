# pre-commit-bump
Tool to automatically bump the pre-commit hook versions in your `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file.
Mainly build for learning purposes, but can be useful for automating the process of updating pre-commit hooks.
As of the time of writing, dependabot does not support pre-commit hooks, so this tool can be used as a workaround.
